<p>As someone who has put hundreds of hours into getting the platinum trophies of both Red Dead Redemption games,
	 I've had to view my fair share of guides, maps, and lists. And one thing I noticed? They all suck.
	  They give bad locations, bombard you with ads, and crash all the time. Will this be a complex site? 
	  No, but I'd like to think I know my stuff and can give decent advice for the more
	   confusing parts of this platinum.</p>

<h3> This Game Is Awesome </h3>

<p>Some people say this game can be boring, or the platinum can draw out. While this is all true, I had the <strong> time of my life</strong>.
	 The quiet afterschool nights of me locking in on hunting for hours, the gambling challenges, the 12 minute horse races across the map,
	all of it seems mundane and goofy the way I explain it, but once you understand it, you <strong> UNDERSTAND </strong> it.
All this isn't even taking in the 10/10 story, characters, dialogue, map, ambience, graphics, attention to detail, and the insane worldbuilding.
I'd imagine you already knew all of this if you're looking at the platinum guide, but I had to get all that out there.</p>
